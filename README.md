<h1 align="left">Hellooo 👋</h1>

<p align="left">My name is Loc, a Monash data science graduate. I am currently seeking for a graduate data science job within Australia and beyond.</p>

<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

###

<p align="left">✨ I am fond of building machine learning models !<br>📚 I have graduated with a First Class Honours at Monash with a thesis about the application of Detection Transformer in live traffic.<br>🎯 Goals: I want to become an all-rounder that can build any model that comes into mind.<br>🎲 Fun fact: If I don't like something I tend to do that thing well :<<br>⚡ Most important thing about me: I am very competitive 😊. For example:<br>- As a gamer, I don't play Valorant for fun, but I tried hard to eventually won the Australian Esport League - a competition across Australian universities, as a Monash representative player. <br>- As a data science student, I treat projects the same way: I iterate, optimise, and push for strong results until the model performs at a high standard.</p>
